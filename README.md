This script plots a cellular automation using defined rules [https://atlas.wolfram.com/TOC/TOC_101.html].

I've programmed only some of the rules. To choose the rule to be plotted, type the number of the available rules.

The following options can be selected: width, number of steps, starting position and probability of a given tile to become black(meaning that if a rule says that a tile is to become black there is now the additional probability whether this actually happens. The standard, optimal case is a probability = 1.)

Some interesting examples:

Rule 105:
![rule 105 - P1 0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87861c65-5a5e-4a9a-bda9-d475cea7f201)

Rule 45:
![rule 45 - P1 0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54fadc3e-fc31-47c0-a586-7864134d017c)

Rule 225:
![rule 225 - P1 0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/117fff78-ddb0-49bb-9bc4-7912c567654d)
![rule 225 - P0 99](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae24bdb3-b3d4-4fc4-8589-244b6ab911b7)

Rule 22:
![rule 22 - P0 9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/056cd4a8-1bd9-47d3-b20d-be99afed80fc)
